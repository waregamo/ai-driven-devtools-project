## 📌 Overview

This repository contains the implementation and report for the Week 4 assignment on *AI in Software Engineering*. The goal is to demonstrate how AI can automate software development tasks, enhance decision-making, and address common challenges through real-world tools and techniques.

---

## 🧠 Part 1: Theoretical Analysis

Includes:
- Q&A on AI code generation tools, supervised vs unsupervised learning, and bias mitigation.
- Case study response on AIOps and software deployment efficiency.

 View the report in the `Theoretical_Analysis.pdf`.
